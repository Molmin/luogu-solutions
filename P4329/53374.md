## 搬运+翻译COCI官方题解

There are $N!$ (N factorial) different ways of assigning missions to the agents. For $N=20$, this number is too large to go through all of them and find the best. 

有$N!$种任务分配方式。$N=20$太大了，无法遍历找到最佳答案。

Observe that, if we have already assigned agents 1 through $X$ to some $X$ missions, then the probability of the remaining missions being successfully completed does not depend on exactly which of the $X$ agents were assigned to the $X$ missions. This fact allows us to use dynamic programming to solve the task. 

观察到，如果我们已经分配了$x$个任务，那么剩余任务成功完成的概率并不取决于这前$x$个任务。这允许我们使用DP来解决这个任务。

The state in the search will be the subset of missions that have been assigned (implemented using a bitmask), which also contains the number of missions assigned so far $(X)$. The space complexity is $O(2N)$ and the time complexity is $ O(N*2N) $, which fits into the 1 second time and 32 MB memory limits. 

搜索到的状态是已经分配的任务的子集（用状压来搞），包含现在已经分配的任务数。空间复杂度$O(2^n)$，时间复杂度是$O(N*N^2)$，符合1s的时间和32MB的空间限制。
