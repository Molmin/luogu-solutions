## 题目描述
分窗户，可以分成三个一组（$a$组），五个一组（$b$组）或者七个一组（$c$组）

给定$n$个窗户，如果可以表示成$i$个$a$组，$j$个$b$组，$k$个$c$组，那么输出$i$，$j$，$k$

否则输出-1

## 题目思路
本题数据范围很小，暴力加一点剪枝就能过

我们直接三重循环跑1000会t掉，因为$n\le 1000$每类窗户都有最大数量，
分别跑到$334$,$200$,$143$即可，然后每个循环后判断是否已经找到，如果找到直接退出

记得预处理$1$,$2$,$4$，可打表证明之后的都可以找到分组方法

## 暴力代码
```c++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int a[1005];
bool ans;
int main(){
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
		ans=false;
		int n;
		cin>>n;
        if(n==1||n==2||n==4){
			cout<<-1<<endl;
			continue;
		}
		for(int i=0;i<=334;i++){
			for(int j=0;j<=200;j++){
				for(int k=0;k<=143;k++){
					if(i*3+j*5+k*7==n){
						ans=1;
						cout<<i<<" "<<j<<" "<<k<<endl;
						break;
					} 
				}
				if(ans==1)
				break;	
			}
			if(ans==1)
			break;
		}
		if(ans==0)
		cout<<-1<<endl;
	}
}
```
## 源程序打表：
~~用这个就可以$o(1)$过了~~
