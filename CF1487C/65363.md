### Description

There are $n$ soccer teams. In a season, each team will play exactly one game with all the other teams. There are two outcomes of a game:

- If a team is winner, then it gets 3 points. Yet the lost team won't get point.
- If the result of a game is tie, then both of two teams will get 1 point.

You should construct results of each game to get the aims:

- Eventually all the teams have the same points.
- The number of results which is tie should be as small as possible.

### Limitations

$100$ test cases; $1 \leq n \leq 100$.

### Ayalysis

Consider that if $n$ is odd, then the number of games each team will play $(n -1)$ is even. Let $m$ be $\frac {n - 1}{2}$. If each team wins $m$ games and loses $m$ games, then they will gain the same points and the number of result "tie" is zero, which is minimum.

If $n$ is even, then the number of games each team will play is odd. Obviously, if there is no tie, not all the teams will get the same points(if some team wins more than half games it will play, then there must be other team that loses more than half games, then their points will be distinct). Let $x$ be the number of result of "tie". Then the number of result "one winner" is $\frac {n(n-1)}{2} - x$. The total points of the season is $3(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-x) + 2x = \frac{3(n-1)}{2}n + \frac x 2$, which must be divisible by $n$. Then $\frac x 2$ must be divisibly by $n$. We have proven that $x$ can't be $0$. Then $x$ is at least $\frac n 2$. There is no harm to assume that the game between $1$ and $2$, $3$ and $4$, ..., $(n-1)$ and $n$ are draws. Then we will get a same problem with case $n$ is odd: For each team, the number of result to be determined is even.

Let's make a dynamic maintenance for the number of games a team have won and lost, and determine the result of team $1, 2, 3, \dots n$ one by one. For each team (which still needs $k$ games to win), we just need to find the team that has lost the minimum team which hasn't played game with the current team. Continue to do this until $k$ is zero. Then we can construct an answer.

To find the teams of which the number of result "lose" is little, we can use priority_queue or sort for each team.

The time complexity is $O(Tn^2 \log n)$.
