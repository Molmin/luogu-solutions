正常的赛时题解大家可以在这里看 https://www.luogu.com.cn/blog/2-6-5-3-5/ti-xie-t411-post

其实还有一个小优化就是那个 dfs 是可以记忆化的。

其他的东西 cmll02 都写了

这里说一下我是怎么优化的

首先大家的做法基本都要预处理必胜必败局面吧？

这里我开一个搜 16 层的东西在旁边跑，跑了 20s 出来了。

给一下打表程序：

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define write cout<<"player:\n"<<pl[0]<<' '<<pl[1]<<"\ncomputer:\n"<<cp[0]<<' '<<cp[1]<<'\n'<<'\n'

{

    b[0]=a[0],b[1]=a[1];
    if(b[0]>b[1]) swap(b[0],b[1]);
    if(b[0]==3&&b[1]==3||b[0]==3&&b[1]==5||b[0]==1&&b[1]==6) return 1;
    if(b[0]==1&&b[1]==9) return 2;
    if(b[0]==1&&b[1]==5) return -1;
    if(b[0]==5&&b[1]==5) return -2;
    return 0;
}
int jm(int a[2],int b[2])

    if(lx(a)<=0) return 0;
    if(lx(a)+lx(b)>0) return 1;
    if(lx(a)==1)
    {
        if(lx(b)==-1) b[0]=b[1]=1;
        else b[0]=5,b[1]=1;
    }
    else b[0]=b[1]=1;
    return 0;
}

然后跑到了七十多 ms。

然后发现了一件神奇的事情：这题可以打表！太牛逼了！！1~~后知后觉~~

对于每个状态给出反应措施。
