# ~~打表王上线~~
根据某一条~~一点规律都没有的数列~~，我们可以自豪地采用打表。我想到了两种思路~~相信正常人都能想出来~~，要么定义这个数列，要么就用$case$语句打表。我采用的是第二种傻傻的$case$，当然还可以用$if$语句（手动滑稽）

**最后，贴一下代码：**
```pascal
Var n:longint;
Begin
        read(n);
        case n of
                0:write(0);
                1:write(1);
                2:write(1);
                3:write(1);
                4:write(2);
                5:write(1);
                6:write(2);
                7:write(1);
                8:write(5);
                9:write(2);
                10:write(2);
