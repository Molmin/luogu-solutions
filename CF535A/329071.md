[点我看题](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/CF535A)

题意：输入一个 $0$ （题面上是 $1$ ，但是数据出现了 $0$ ）至 $99$ 的整数，转化成英文的写法。

思路&方法：因为 $0 \le n \le 99$ ，数据范围很小，所以我们根本不需要考虑太多，直接打表就可以通过本题。

细节：

- 当 $n$ 为 $0$ 时，要输出 $zero$ 。

代码：

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int num;
char a[105][25]={"zero","one","two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine",
"ten","eleven","twelve","thirteen","fourteen","fifteen","sixteen","seventeen","eighteen",
"nineteen","twenty","twenty-one","twenty-two","twenty-three","twenty-four","twenty-five",
"twenty-six","twenty-seven","twenty-eight","twenty-nine","thirty","thirty-one","thirty-two",
"thirty-three","thirty-four","thirty-five","thirty-six","thirty-seven","thirty-eight",
"thirty-nine","forty","forty-one","forty-two","forty-three","forty-four","forty-five",
"forty-six","forty-seven","forty-eight","forty-nine","fifty","fifty-one","fifty-two",
"fifty-three","fifty-four","fifty-five","fifty-six","fifty-seven","fifty-eight",
"fifty-nine","sixty","sixty-one","sixty-two","sixty-three","sixty-four","sixty-five",
"sixty-six","sixty-seven","sixty-eight","sixty-nine","seventy","seventy-one","seventy-two",
"seventy-three","seventy-four","seventy-five","seventy-six","seventy-seven","seventy-eight",
"seventy-nine","eighty","eighty-one","eighty-two","eighty-three","eighty-four",
"eighty-five","eighty-six","eighty-seven","eighty-eight","eighty-nine","ninety",
"ninety-one","ninety-two","ninety-three","ninety-four","ninety-five","ninety-six",
"ninety-seven","ninety-eight","ninety-nine"};//一个0~99的表
int main()
{
	cin>>num;
	cout<<a[num];//输出结果 
    return 0;
}
