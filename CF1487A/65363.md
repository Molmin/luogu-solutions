## CF1487A

### Description

There are $n$ heroes in the Arena. Firstly The ability of $i$-th hero is $a_i$.

Every minutes, a fight between two different heroes, who are chosen randomly, occurs.

if the ability of hero $x$ is greater than that of hero $y$, $x$ will win. Then the ability of hero $x$ increases by $1$.

You should calculate how many heroes might win more than $100^{500}$ times.

### Limitations

$500$ test cases; $2 \leq n \leq 100$; $1 \leq a_i \leq 100$.

## Analysis

Let $m$ be the minimum of $a$. Obviously, if a hero's ability is initially greater than $a$, then he can fight with the one whose ability is $m$ for $100^{500}$ times, then he wins. And the hero with minimum ability will never win.

So we just need to check the number of heroes whose abilities are grater than $m$.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  static public void main(String[] argc) {
    Scanner cin = new Scanner(System.in);
    for (int intT = cin.nextInt(), intN; intT != 0; --intT) {
      intN = cin.nextInt();
      int[] intarrAbility = new int[intN];
      for (int i = 0; i < intN; ++i) {
        intarrAbility[i] = cin.nextInt();
      }
      Arrays.sort(intarrAbility);
      int intAns = 0;
      for (int i = 1; i < intN; ++i) if (intarrAbility[i] != intarrAbility[0]) ++intAns;
      System.out.println(intAns);
    }
  }
}
```
