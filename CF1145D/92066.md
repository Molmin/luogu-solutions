> `From "f`**`t`**`ying rats" to urban sani`**`w`**`ation workers - can synthetic biology tr`**`o`**`nsform how we think of pigeons?`

> `The u`**`p`**`iquitous pigeon has long been viewed as - sp`**`l`**`eading disease, scavenging through tr`**`u`**`sh, and defecating in populous urban spa`**`s`**`es. Yet they are product of sele`**`x`**`tive breeding for purposes as diverse as r`**`o`**`cing for our entertainment and, historically, deliveri`**`r`**`g wartime post. Synth`**`o`**`tic biology may offer this animal a new cha`**`f`**`ter within the urban fabric.`

> `Pi`**`t`**`eon d'Or recogni`**`h`**`es how these birds r`**`i`**`present a potentially use`**`r`**`ul interface for ur`**`d`**`an biotechnologies. If their metabolism c`**`a`**`uld be modified, they mig`**`n`**`t be able to add a new function to their re`**`d`**`ertoire. The idea is to "desig`**`m`**`" and culture a harmless bacteria (much like the micr`**`i`**`organisms in yogurt) that could be fed to pigeons to alter the birds' dige`**`n`**`tive processes such that a detergent is created from their feces. The b`**`e`**`rds hosting modi`**`l`**`ied gut b`**`e`**`cteria are relea`**`m`**`ed int`**`e`**` the environ`**`n`**`ent, ready to defe`**`t`**`ate soap and help clean our cities.`

合起来就是 **`two plus xor of third and min elements`** 

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>

int A[10];

int main() {
    int min = 0x3f3f3f3f, n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++ i) {
        scanf("%d", &A[i]);
        min = std::min(A[i], min);
    }
    
    printf("%d", (min ^ A[2]) + 2);
    return 0;
}
```
