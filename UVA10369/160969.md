/**
 * Description
 * The Department of National Defence (DND) wishes to connect several northern outposts by a wireless network.
 * Two different communication technologies are to be used in establishing the network:
 * every outpost will have a radio transceiver and some outposts will in addition have a satellite channel.
 * Any two outposts with a satellite channel can communicate via the satellite,
 * regardless of their location.
 * Otherwise, two outposts can communicate by radio only if the distance
 * between them does not exceed D,
 * which depends of the power of the transceivers.
 * Higher power yields higher D but costs more.
 * Due to purchasing and maintenance
 * considerations, the transceivers at the outposts must be identical;
 * that is, the value of D is the same for every pair of outposts.
 * Your job is to determine the minimum D required for the transceivers.
 * There must be at least one communication path (direct or indirect) between every pair of outposts.
 * Input
 * The first line of input contains N, the number of test cases.
 * The first line of each test case contains 1 <= S <= 100,
 * the number of satellite channels, and S < P <= 500, the number
 * of outposts. P lines follow,
 * giving the (x,y) coordinates of each outpost in km (coordinates are integers between 0 and 10,000).
 * Output
 * For each case, output should consist of a single line giving the minimum D required to connect the network.
 * Output should be specified to 2 decimal points.
 * Sample Input
 * Language: Default
 *
 * 1
 * 2 4
 * 0 100
 * 0 300
 * 0 600
 * 150 750
 * Sample Output
 * 212.13
